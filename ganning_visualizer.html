    <p>This thing is a better artist than me.</p>
    <p>This Processing program allows users to input an audio file (.mp3) and creates waveforms that describe the music.
        Additionally, balls bounce around the screen at a speed that's proportional to the loudness of the music. In the
        end, the paths of these balls create a piece of art, which is better than what I can draw. Click to start audio.
