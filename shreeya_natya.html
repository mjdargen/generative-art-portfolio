    <p>Nāṭya (dance)</p>
    <p>This piece uses generative art and interactivity to showcase pixelated Bharatanatyam dancers that you can
        zoom in and out of. The three dancers are in different Bharatanatyam positions, Bharatanatyam, which means
        rhythm and dance, is a type of Indian classical dance. When creating the piece I used many for loops to loop
        through each pixel of the image and replace it with a shade of gray depending on the original color of the
        pixel. I created this piece to showcase a different type of dance using a method of art I’ve never used before,
        generative art. Click to begin audio.</p>
