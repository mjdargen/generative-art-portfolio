    <p>Interactivity</p>

    <p>This piece portrays the finality of human intervention. Once the image is altered, it cannot be reset by a human.
        If you choose to interact with this piece, you are fundamentally changing its composition. By making art
        interactive, the artist surrenders control of their piece and allows each person to create their own
        meaning. Takes a second to load. Move mouse to interact with the image.</p>
