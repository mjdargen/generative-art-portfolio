    <p>Title: Four Seasons</p>

    <p>This is an interactive generative art piece where the users/viewers can create a landscape image.
        By clicking the space bar, the season changes in the order of "spring", "summer", "fall", "winter" and back to
        “spring” By using the mouse the user can draw a cloud or a butterfly. The mode of the brush can be changed by
        clicking the "c" key. By clicking the backspace key, you can reset the image.</p>
    <p>This piece also shows the changes in time as the landscape is drawn continuously to fill the canvas, the color of
        the field for the seasons changes gradually, and last but not least the clouds and the butterflies that was
        created gradually disappears and covered by other dots. The changes doesn't show drastically, it requires some
        patience to see a big change, however it is very meaningful because small changes by new addition of dots are
        being made continuously.</p>
    <p>Uniqueness about this piece is that every dots, colors, along with the users interaction creates a different
        scenery and a same piece can never be replicated. The randomness in this artworks allows user to
        create/customize their one and only piece.</p>
    <p>Last but not least, some impressionist's principles such as the changes by the lights are incorporated with this
        landscape images as the diverse color to depict the changes by the lights are randomly added.</p>
